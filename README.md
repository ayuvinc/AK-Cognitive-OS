# AK Cognitive OS — Agentic AI Software Company Framework

A portable, file-based multi-persona development framework for building software with AI agents.
Clone it, fill in your project context, and your AI team is ready to work.

Status: **v1.0** — Fully published. All personas, skills, schemas, guides, and project template complete.

---

## What This Is

A complete operating system for running a software project using AI personas as a team.
Each persona has a defined role, clear boundaries, and a slash command to activate it.
All handoffs happen through files — no direct terminal communication required.

Both Claude and Codex are supported with full role parity. The framework runs in three modes:
COMBINED (default), SOLO_CLAUDE, and SOLO_CODEX.

---

## The Team

Personas and skills are defined in `personas/` and `skills/` — see directory listing for the full set.

**Core personas:**
| Command | Persona | Job |
|---|---|---|
| `/architect` | Architect | System design, task definition, constraints |
| `/ba` | Business Analyst | Requirements, business logic, edge cases |
| `/ux` | UX Designer | UX specs, interaction constraints, mobile |
| `/junior-dev` | Junior Developer | Implementation, exact scope only |
| `/qa` | QA Engineer | Acceptance criteria, quality gate |
| `/researcher` | Researcher | Sourced research briefs (5 sub-personas) |
| `/compliance` | Compliance Reviewer | S0/S1/S2 compliance gate |

---

## How to Use

See `QUICKSTART.md` for the full 15-minute setup guide.

### Quick steps

1. Clone this repo
2. Complete `guides/00-project-intake.md` — answer all 10 sections
3. Choose your stack using `guides/06-tooling-baseline.md`
4. Back up existing `~/.claude/commands/` then copy all persona and skill commands
5. Copy `project-template/` contents to your project (including `touch releases/audit-log.md`)
6. Fill in `CLAUDE.md` placeholders with your project context and intake summary
7. Open Claude from your project root: `cd [your-project] && claude`
8. Run `/session-open` and start building

## The Workflow

```
AK gives requirements
  → BA confirms business logic         (tasks/ba-logic.md)
  → UX designs the experience          (tasks/ux-specs.md)
  → Architect plans + writes tasks     (tasks/todo.md)
  → QA adds acceptance criteria        (tasks/todo.md)
  → Junior Dev builds                  (code + tests)
  → Sprint packager + intake check     (review packet for Codex)
  → Codex reviews                      (COMBINED mode)
  → QA validates                       (QA_APPROVED gate)
  → Architect + UX review
  → Session close + audit log
```

Compliance persona can intercept at any stage. S0 = hard stop, nothing ships.
Researcher persona answers questions ad-hoc at any stage.

---

## Execution Modes

| Mode | When | Who |
|---|---|---|
| COMBINED (default) | Standard features, bug fixes, refactors | Claude + Codex |
| SOLO_CLAUDE | Codex unavailable, hotfix, simple task | Claude only |
| SOLO_CODEX | Claude unavailable (degraded) | Codex only |

See `framework/dual-stack-architecture.md` for full mode specification.

---

## Persona Boundaries

Every persona has explicit **CAN / CANNOT** rules. When a request falls outside those rules,
the persona emits a **BOUNDARY_FLAG** and stops — it does not comply or refuse silently.

---

## Compliance Gate

The compliance persona uses three severity tiers:
- **S0** — Hard block. Nothing ships until resolved.
- **S1** — AK decision required. Fix before launch or explicitly accept risk.
- **S2** — Advisory. Log and defer.

---

## Origin

Built and battle-tested on a production fitness coaching platform.
Distilled into this framework for reuse across any software project.

---

## About the Author

**AK** is a product manager and entrepreneur building AI-powered software products
without a traditional engineering background. His approach: use AI agents as the
engineering team, and focus personal energy on product vision, business logic, and
user experience.

Current projects:
- **machinepersonhood.com** — AI agent staffing agency (in design)

AK built the workflow that became this framework while shipping a production web app solo
using Claude Code + Codex as a dual-stack AI engineering team.
