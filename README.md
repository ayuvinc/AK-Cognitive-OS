# AK Cognitive OS

A portable, file-based multi-persona development framework for building software with Claude Code and Codex.

Status: **v3.0** — 20 rationalized commands, three-layer enforcement (hooks + commands + governance docs), operating tier awareness (MVP / Standard / High-Risk), canonical 11-stage lifecycle, and machine-enforced governance.

---

## What This Is

AK Cognitive OS is a structured delivery framework for running a software project with AI agents as explicit roles.

- personas define responsibilities and boundaries
- skills define repeatable workflow actions
- planning artifacts provide traceable delivery context
- hooks add runtime guardrails for Claude Code sessions
- validators check repository integrity and framework contracts

Both Claude and Codex are supported. The framework runs in three modes: `COMBINED` (default), `SOLO_CLAUDE`, and `SOLO_CODEX`.

---

## The Team

Personas and skills are defined in `personas/` and `skills/`. Every artifact belongs to one of five classes — see [`framework/governance/role-taxonomy.md`](framework/governance/role-taxonomy.md) for the full classification table and routing logic.

**Delivery personas** — own named roles in the delivery chain:
| Command | Persona | Job |
|---|---|---|
| `/architect` | Architect | System design, task definition, constraints |
| `/ba` | Business Analyst | Requirements, business logic, edge cases |
| `/ux` | UX Designer | Interaction behavior, states, breakpoints, accessibility |
| `/designer` | Designer | Visual direction, brand, component look-and-feel |
| `/junior-dev` | Junior Developer | Implementation, exact scope only |
| `/qa` | QA Engineer | Acceptance criteria design, quality intent gate |

**Router personas** — broad-scope personas that handle multi-domain requests internally:
| Command | Persona | Job |
|---|---|---|
| `/researcher` | Researcher | Business, legal, news, policy, and technical research — unified |
| `/compliance` | Compliance | Data privacy, security, PHI, and PII review — unified |

**Skills** — mechanical (session lifecycle, gating, CI checks) and advisory/meta (framework health). Full list: [`framework/governance/role-taxonomy.md`](framework/governance/role-taxonomy.md).

## The 20 Commands (v3.0)

```
Session:      /session-open  /session-close  /compact-session
Personas:     /architect  /ba  /junior-dev  /qa  /ux  /designer
Quality:      /qa-run  /security-sweep  /compliance
Research:     /researcher
Codex:        /codex-prep  /codex-read
Intelligence: /teach-me  /lessons-extractor  /risk-manager
Utility:      /audit-log  /check-channel
```

---

## Operating Tiers

Every project runs at one of three tiers. The tier controls which gates are enforced:

| Tier | Who it's for | Planning gates | Compliance gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| **MVP** | Prototypes, experiments, internal tools | Advisory | No |
| **Standard** | Most real-world projects (default) | Enforced | No |
| **High-Risk** | Regulated, sensitive data, high-stakes | Enforced | Yes (every stage) |

Set `Tier:` in your project's `CLAUDE.md`. See `guides/14-risk-tier-selection.md`.

---

## Start Here

New? Start with these four files in order:

| Step | File | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `guides/00-project-intake.md` | Answer questions about your product before touching code |
| 2 | `DECISION_MATRIX.md` | Choose your stack based on intake answers |
| 3 | `QUICKSTART.md` | Full setup walkthrough with scripts |
| 4 | `project-template/CLAUDE_START.md` | First-run sequence once Claude is open |

Not sure about a term? See `glossary.md`. Stuck? See `guides/07-common-failures.md` or `FAQ.md`.

---

## Quick Start

See `QUICKSTART.md` for the full setup guide.

> **Note:** All scripts require bash. Run them with `bash scripts/<name>.sh`, not `sh` or `zsh`.

```bash
# 1. Clone the framework
git clone https://github.com/ayuvinc/AK-Cognitive-OS.git ~/AK-Cognitive-OS

# 2. Install all personas + skills into Claude
~/AK-Cognitive-OS/scripts/install-claude-commands.sh --backup

# 3. Bootstrap your project with v3.0 native Claude Code files
~/AK-Cognitive-OS/scripts/bootstrap-project.sh ~/[your-project]

# 4. Validate the framework repo itself
cd ~/AK-Cognitive-OS
bash scripts/validate-framework.sh
```

Then move into your target project, review `CLAUDE.md`, and open Claude Code.

## What v3.0 Adds

- 20 rationalized commands — clean, purposeful, no duplicates (retired sprint-packager, regression-guard, handoff-validator, codex-creator, codex-delta-verify, framework-delta-log)
- Three-layer enforcement: hooks (runtime), commands (role contracts), governance docs (policy)
- Operating tier system — MVP / Standard / High-Risk with tier-appropriate gate enforcement
- Canonical 11-stage delivery lifecycle with formal stage-gate documents
- Artifact ownership map — every file has an owner; personas blocked from touching what isn't theirs
- Machine-enforced governance — validators/governance.py auto-discovered by runner.py; governance FAIL blocks push to main
- Expanded framework validation from 14 checks to 20 structural checks + semantic lint

## Planning Artifacts

Every non-trivial project starts with structured conversation and planning docs before code.

```
Discovery Conversation → Problem/Scope docs → HLD → LLD → Tasks → Build → QA → Release
```

| Doc | Purpose | Required Before |
|-----|---------|-----------------|
| `docs/problem-definition.md` | Who, what, why | Any build work |
| `docs/scope-brief.md` | Must-have, out-of-scope, delivery target | Any build work |
| `docs/hld.md` | Architecture, data flow, integrations | Multi-feature sprint |
| `docs/lld/<feature>.md` | Implementation details per feature | Feature implementation |
| `docs/assumptions.md` | What's confirmed vs inferred vs unresolved | Ongoing |
| `docs/decision-log.md` | Decisions with provenance | Ongoing |
| `docs/release-truth.md` | Honest feature status: real/mocked/partial/deferred | Demo or release |
| `docs/traceability-matrix.md` | Task → scope → HLD → LLD → tests mapping | Task derivation |

Two entry paths: **greenfield** (new projects, Guide 11) and **recovery** (mid-build projects, Guide 12).

## Enforcement Layer

v3.0 enforcement runs through three layers. All three must be installed for enforcement to hold:

**Layer 1 — Hooks** (`settings.json` → `scripts/hooks/`)
Claude Code runtime executes these before and after tool calls. Claude cannot bypass them.
Enforces: session state transitions, persona boundaries, push protection, envelope validation, governance gates.

**Layer 2 — Commands** (`.claude/commands/`)
20 commands loaded by the project. Claude reads and follows WHO YOU ARE / CAN / CANNOT rules.
Enforces: role boundaries, output contracts, escalation paths.

**Layer 3 — Governance Docs** (`framework/governance/`)
Referenced by commands and CLAUDE.md. Defines what to enforce and when.
Enforces: lifecycle stages, stage gates, artifact ownership, operating tiers, change policy.

Hook scripts (wired via `settings.json`):
- `guard-session-state.sh` — blocks unauthorized SESSION STATE writes
- `guard-persona-boundaries.sh` — blocks out-of-boundary artifact writes
- `guard-planning-artifacts.sh` — blocks code writes when planning docs absent (Standard/High-Risk)
- `guard-git-push.sh` — blocks push to main without QA_APPROVED + governance pass
- `auto-audit-log.sh` — appends audit entries automatically
- `auto-persona-detect.sh` — detects active persona from context
- `auto-teach.sh` — triggers `/teach-me` when task goes IN_PROGRESS
- `auto-codex-prep.sh` — triggers `/codex-prep` when task goes READY_FOR_REVIEW
- `auto-codex-read.sh` — triggers `/codex-read` when Codex verdict is written
- `set-teach-me-flag.sh` / `set-codex-prep-flag.sh` — PostToolUse flag setters for auto-hooks
- `session-integrity-check.sh` — warns on unclosed sessions + advisory checks
- `validate-envelope.sh` — validates output envelope on every agent response

---

## The Workflow

```
Discovery conversation (8 questions)
  → Confirm problem-definition.md + scope-brief.md
  → HLD conversation → confirm hld.md
  → LLD for first features
  → Derive tasks into todo.md
  → BA confirms business logic         (tasks/ba-logic.md)
  → UX designs the experience          (tasks/ux-specs.md)
  → QA adds acceptance criteria        (tasks/todo.md)
  → Junior Dev builds                  (code + tests)
  → Sprint packager + intake check     (review packet for Codex)
  → Codex reviews                      (COMBINED mode)
  → QA validates                       (QA_APPROVED gate)
  → Architect + UX review
  → Session close + audit log
```

Compliance persona can intercept at any stage. S0 = hard stop, nothing ships.
Researcher persona answers questions ad-hoc at any stage.

---

## Execution Modes

| Mode | When | Who |
|---|---|---|
| COMBINED (default) | Standard features, bug fixes, refactors | Claude + Codex |
| SOLO_CLAUDE | Codex unavailable, hotfix, simple task | Claude only |
| SOLO_CODEX | Claude unavailable (degraded) | Codex only |

See `framework/dual-stack-architecture.md` for full mode specification.

---

## Persona Boundaries

Every persona has explicit **CAN / CANNOT** rules. When a request falls outside those rules,
the persona emits a **BOUNDARY_FLAG** and stops — it does not comply or refuse silently.

## Compliance Gate

The compliance persona uses three severity tiers:
- **S0** — Hard block. Nothing ships until resolved.
- **S1** — AK decision required. Fix before launch or explicitly accept risk.
- **S2** — Advisory. Log and defer.

## Origin

Built and battle-tested on a production fitness coaching platform.
Distilled into this framework for reuse across any software project.

## About the Author

**AK** is a product manager and entrepreneur building AI-powered software products
without a traditional engineering background. His approach: use AI agents as the
engineering team, and focus personal energy on product vision, business logic, and
user experience.

Current projects:
- **machinepersonhood.com** — AI agent staffing agency (in design)

AK built the workflow that became this framework while shipping a production web app solo
using Claude Code + Codex as a dual-stack AI engineering team.
